# Unofficial ChatGPT Client Library

An unofficial, educational Python library demonstrating interaction with ChatGPT models. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles and API interaction patterns through a clean, type-safe implementation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Disclaimers

**IMPORTANT: This is an UNOFFICIAL library and is not affiliated with, officially supported by, or endorsed by OpenAI.**

This code is provided **strictly for educational purposes** to demonstrate:
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Python best practices
- API interaction patterns
- Type-safe programming

**DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR:**
- Production environments
- Commercial purposes
- Automated interaction with ChatGPT
- Bypassing API rate limits or terms of service
- Any purpose that violates OpenAI's terms of service

For production applications, please use [OpenAI's official API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and follow their guidelines and terms of service.

## Educational Value

This project serves as a learning resource for:
- üéØ Understanding type-safe Python programming
- üèóÔ∏è Implementing object-oriented design patterns
- üõ°Ô∏è Developing robust error handling systems
- üìù Writing clean, maintainable code
- ‚ö° Managing asynchronous operations
- üîÑ Creating extensible software architectures

## Features

- Type-safe implementation with comprehensive type hints
- Object-oriented design with abstract base classes
- Custom exception hierarchy for detailed error handling
- Extensive documentation and examples
- Task polling with status tracking
- Support for multiple model versions (for educational purposes)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/Unofficial-ChatGPT-Client-Library.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Unofficial-ChatGPT-Client-Library

# Install required packages
pip install requests
```

## Educational Usage Examples

### Basic Example

```python
from chatgpt_client import ChatGPTClient, Message

# Initialize the client
client = ChatGPTClient()

# Create messages
messages = [
    Message(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    Message(role="user", content="Explain Python decorators.")
]

try:
    # Generate response
    response = client.generate_response(messages)
    print(f"Response: {response}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

### Model Selection Example

```python
# Demonstrating different model selection
response = client.generate_response(messages, model="GPT-4")
```

## Error Handling

The library implements a comprehensive error handling system for educational purposes:

```python
try:
    response = client.generate_response(messages)
except ModelNotFoundError as e:
    print("Model selection error:", str(e))
except APIError as e:
    print("API interaction error:", str(e))
except ChatGPTError as e:
    print("General error:", str(e))
```

### Contribution Focus Areas

- Improving code documentation
- Adding educational examples
- Enhancing error handling demonstrations
- Including more programming best practices
- Adding helpful comments explaining complex patterns

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- requests
- typing-extensions
- dataclasses (for Python < 3.7)

## Important Note

This project is meant solely for educational purposes and learning software development concepts. For any actual interaction with ChatGPT or other AI models, always:

    1. Use official APIs and SDKs
    2. Follow the service provider's terms of service
    3. Obtain proper authentication and authorization
    4. Respect rate limits and usage guidelines
    5. Consider ethical implications of AI usage
